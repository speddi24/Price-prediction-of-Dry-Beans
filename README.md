Classifying and Predicting the price of dry beans.

Dry beans are widely produced all over the world. However, due to their sensitivity to the climate and unavailability of
certified beans for the cultivation, a mixed variety of beans often result in unfair market prices. Previous studies have shown that computer version and machine leraning techniques can be used to measure morphological features of beans 
and accurately predict classes of beans from those features. For this study, multiple machine learning classification models were investigated to find robust model that could expand on this area to predict the price of one pound of beans from varous farms with accuracy. With these methods, farmers and consumers can feel more confident that they are receiving a fair and equitable price.

Across all the models that were analyzed, the accuracy of predicting the class of each bean was relatively stable. Due to the physical make up of the beans, some of the varietis were more easily predicted than others. Unfortunately, the variables used to predict between the Dermason and Sira beans varieties did not provide great separation for an accurate prediction.Given the value difference with these beans, depending on the distribution of the class of beans within the sample, the price may vary widely. Additionally, although bootstrap sample was normally distributed in the simulated data, the actual price of our predictions fell outside the confidance interval. Further exploration is needed to find a methodology used to estimate each price of the bean which may provide a more accurate estimated price.
